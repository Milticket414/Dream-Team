# The Dream Dashboard

## Members:

*Ryan Resiner, Chinedozi Eronini, Jorge Abud, Mark Murdock, and Katie Funk*

## Purpose: 

*Bringing together the wildly disparate data of the investment world into a one-stop-shop interactive dashboard!*

## What Problem are we solving?

Building portfolios is difficult and time consuming. The amount of grunt work necessary in order to cross reference stock prices, alternative investments, and other commodities can be a daunting task. 

## What Research Questions do we have?

*-which asset holds the most promise as a store of value?*

*-which asset class is the most/least volatile?**

-how does rebalancing affect the portfolio over an extended period?*

*-is it possible to create a portfolio with correlation under .15 using the options below?*

## What are we Offering: 

*An interactive dashboard that allows the end user to build a personalized portfolio. Using the last ten years of data, we will be able to show the reader the current value of their portfolio (had they invested 10 years ago) and be able to roughly project over the next 1,5,10 years. Furthermore, we will be able to compare/contrast their portfolio instantly with tabs/sliders/etc, allowing the end user to see the differences in the portfolio with rebalancing/periodic investment (instead of lump sum)/ etc.*

*We will also show the best case scenario vs worst case scenario of investments over the last 10 years.*

## What Data are we using?

*-Bitcoin*

*-S&P 500*

*-FANG Stocks*

*-Art ETF*

*-Real Estate ETF*

*-Gold ETF*
