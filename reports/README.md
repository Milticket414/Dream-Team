# Summary of Presentation

## The Dream Portfolio:

### Broken Down Into 5 Categories:

1. Explanation of project

- The Dream Team has created a project that allows an end user to do three things. 
First, we created a base graph bringing together five of our favorite asset classes (BTC, Gold,VNQ, SP500, FAANG) into a single cumulative returns graph.
Second, we pulled each asset into an efficient frontier analsysis in order to get a projection for our $150000 investment AND the best weights/allocation for the assets.
Third, we used the weights from the EFA to create a Monte Carlo that gives the end user a range or outputs based on their investment.

2. Data Clean-Up

-Main Idea = CSV's are invented for 2020...they're a mess!  API's give me hope for the future. 

Check out how terrible this CSV is

Compared to how beautiful of a graph an API produced

4. Efficient Frontier Analysis

5. Monte Carlo and how much we earned
